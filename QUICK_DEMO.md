## ⚡ Super Quick Demo (2 Minutes)

### Option 1: Interactive Launcher (Easiest!)

```bash
python run_demo.py
```

Then choose from the menu:
- Press `1` - Test API (30 sec)
- Press `2` - Multi-Patient Demo (2 min)
- Press `3` - Conflict Resolution (2 min)
- Press `6` - Run ALL demos (8 min)

---

### Option 2: Manual Commands

#### Test Everything Works
```bash
python test_claude_api.py
```
✅ Should show: "Claude API is working correctly!"

#### Run Best Demo
```bash
python scenarios/multi_patient_demo.py
```
✅ Shows 3 critical patients coordinated simultaneously

## 🎥 For Recording Demo Video

### Quick Setup (1 minute)
```bash
# 1. Clear screen
cls

# 2. Make terminal large/fullscreen

# 3. Test once
python scenarios/multi_patient_demo.py
```

### Record These 3 Demos (8 minutes total)

#### Demo 1: Multi-Patient (2 min)
```bash
python scenarios/multi_patient_demo.py
```
**Shows:** 3 patients, AI prioritization, parallel protocols

#### Demo 2: Conflict Resolution (2 min)
```bash
python scenarios/conflict_resolution_demo.py
```
**Shows:** ED full, AI resolves conflict, optimal solution

#### Demo 3: Live AI (2 min)
```bash
python simulate_patient_flow.py
```
**Shows:** Real AI analysis, STEMI detection, <2s response

## 📊 What Each Demo Shows

### 🏥 Multi-Patient Demo
```
INPUT:  3 critical patients arrive at once
        - STEMI (chest pain)
        - Stroke (facial droop)
        - Trauma (MVA, GCS 8)

AI:     Analyzes all 3 simultaneously
        Prioritizes: Trauma → STEMI → Stroke
        
OUTPUT: All 3 protocols activated
        All timing targets met
        Zero resource conflicts
```

### ⚡ Conflict Resolution Demo
```
INPUT:  ED at full capacity
        New critical STEMI patient arrives
        No beds available

AI:     Generates 3 resolution options
        Selects optimal solution (95% confidence)
        
OUTPUT: Stable patient transferred to floor
        Critical bed freed in 5 minutes
        STEMI patient gets immediate care
```

### 🤖 Live AI Analysis Demo
```
INPUT:  76yo M with chest pain
        ST elevation on ECG
        Vitals: HR 95, BP 145/90

AI:     Analyzes patient data
        Identifies STEMI protocol
        
OUTPUT: Acuity Level 1
        Protocol: STEMI
        Response time: 2.00s
        Confidence: 90%
```

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Demo Won't Run?
```bash
# Check you're in right directory
cd D:\project\finallevelprojects\ED-FOx

# Try again
python scenarios/multi_patient_demo.py
```

### API Error?
```bash
# Test API first
python test_claude_api.py

# If fails, demos still work (fallback mode)
```

### Unicode Error?
```bash
# Use the launcher (handles it automatically)
python run_demo.py
```

## 🎬 Demo Script (30 seconds each)

### Multi-Patient Demo
> "Watch as three critical patients arrive simultaneously. Our AI analyzes all three in real-time, intelligently prioritizes them, and activates all protocols in parallel. All timing targets are met with zero resource conflicts."

### Conflict Resolution Demo
> "The ED is at full capacity when a critical STEMI patient arrives. Our AI generates three resolution options, selects the optimal solution with 95% confidence, and resolves the conflict in just 5 minutes."

### Live AI Analysis Demo
> "This is a live demonstration with real Claude AI. Watch as the system processes an actual STEMI patient, analyzes the data, and identifies the appropriate protocol in under 2 seconds."
