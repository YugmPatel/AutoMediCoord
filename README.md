# ED-FOx — Emergency Department Flow Optimizer (Template)

Clean starter for a Fetch.ai agentic project with a separate frontend.

## Structure

- `apps/backend` — Python package `ed_fox` (uAgents, integrations, runner)
- `apps/frontend` — Frontend scaffold (Vite/React/Tailwind; placeholder)
- `docs` — Architecture, API contracts, demo script

## Quick start

1. Create and fill `.env` from `.env.example`.
2. Build backend + frontend in their folders (see READMEs inside each app).
3. Open `docs/DEMO.md` for the 60–90s demo flow once code is added.
